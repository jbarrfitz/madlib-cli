# LAB - Class 03

## Project: File IO and Exceptions

## Author: Jerry Barrows-Fitzgerald

## Setup

### To run

 - python madlib.py

### Tests

Each of the functions is tested using pytest, evaluating
output against expected values, including a test of the 
output to a new file, accomplished by creating a temp file
and checking its content against the input text from the 
MadLib. Run 'pytest' to see the results of these tests.
